Ever wondered how `function*` in JavaScript actually works? Or what happens when you mix in `async`? Let’s explore generator functions, how they maintain state, and how they play with the `async` keyword.

## 🌀 What is a Generator Function?

A generator function is defined with `function*` and uses the `yield` keyword to pause execution. When you call it, it returns an **iterator** that lets you step through its execution.

```js
function* countUp() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const counter = countUp();
console.log(counter.next().value); // 1
console.log(counter.next().value); // 2
console.log(counter.next().value); // 3
```

Each time you call `.next()`, the generator resumes from where it left off. This means it **remembers local variables and state** between calls. Pretty neat, right?

## 🧠 How is State Maintained?

Check this out:

```js
function* counter() {
  let x = 10;
  yield x;
  x++;
  yield x;
}

const gen = counter();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 10
console.log(gen.next().value); // 11
```

Even though we paused execution with `yield`, the variable `x` persisted. That’s the magic — the generator keeps its own execution context.

## ⚡ What About `async`?

You can’t do `async function*` and expect it to behave like a regular `function*`. But you **can** use `async function*` to create an **asynchronous generator**.

This lets you both `await` and `yield`, which is useful when working with streams or network requests.

```js
async function* fetchData() {
  const res1 = await fetch('/api/data1');
  yield await res1.json();

  const res2 = await fetch('/api/data2');
  yield await res2.json();
}
```

You’d consume it like this:

```js
(async () => {
  for await (const item of fetchData()) {
    console.log(item);
  }
})();
```

Yup, **`for await...of`** is how you loop over values from an async generator.

## ⏳ Async Generators Maintain State Too

They don’t just pause at `yield`, they also wait for promises to resolve. Here’s a basic countdown:

```js
async function* countdown() {
  let i = 3;
  while (i > 0) {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000)); // wait 1 sec
    yield i--;
  }
}

(async () => {
  for await (const num of countdown()) {
    console.log(num); // 3, 2, 1 (with 1 sec between)
  }
})();
```

The function keeps track of `i` and where it left off — just like a regular generator, but asynchronous.

## 🚀 Wrap-up

So yes, generator functions **do maintain state**, and async generators take it a step further by waiting on promises too. They're incredibly useful when dealing with streams, pagination, or chunked APIs.

Next time you see a `function*` or `async function*`, remember: you’re working with mini state machines that can pause, resume, and even wait on the network. This greatly helps in streaming responses from LLM. Checkout my [other blog](https://bharathvaj.com/posts/async-generator-sse/) on how generator works with SSE.
