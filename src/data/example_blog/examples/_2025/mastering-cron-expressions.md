[CRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) expressions are powerful tools for scheduling tasks — from backups to emails — across servers, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines. While they may look cryptic at first, once you decode the pattern, you unlock a whole new level of automation.

### 🔹 What is a CRON Expression?

A CRON expression is a string with **5 space-separated fields** (sometimes 6 or 7 depending on the system) that define a recurring schedule.

```
┌──────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌──── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
│ │ │ │ ┌─ day of week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### 🔹 Tips & Tools

- **Always test** your expressions using tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) or [Cronhub](https://cronhub.io).

- This format changes based on the system. For example, the Quartz CRON scheduler has a slightly different format to support extra capabilities, such as seconds and nth recursive patterns, like the 3rd Friday of the month. Similarly AWS Cloudwatch has different one.
